# credit_card_Analysis
 Project Overview:-

--> This project focuses on analyzing credit card transactions and customer data to uncover spending patterns, revenue drivers, and customer behavior. Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards that provide insights into revenue generation, customer demographics, card categories, and transaction trends.

 -> What I Did in This Project:-
Data Collection & Understanding
Collected credit card transaction dataset (customer details, transaction amount, revenue, interest earned, demographics).
Understood data fields such as card category, income, age, education, job profile, expense type, marital status, and state.

-> Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:-
Ensured data consistency (e.g., handling unknown/blank education & marital status).
Standardized columns for analysis (transaction amount, revenue, income groups).

-> Data Modeling in Power BI:-
Built relationships between transaction and customer datasets.

-> Created measures such as:-
Total Revenue
Total Transaction Amount
Total Interest Earned
Customer Income
Dashboard & Visualization

-> Designed Credit Card Transaction Report:-
Revenue by expense type (bills, fuel, grocery, food, entertainment, travel).
Revenue by card category (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum).
Revenue by transaction mode (Swipe, Chip, Online).
Quarterly revenue & transaction count trends.
Designed Credit Card Customer Report:
Revenue by customer job profile.
Revenue by education level.
Revenue by age group & income group.
Top 5 states by revenue.
Revenue by marital status & dependents.
 
-> Key Findings:-
Blue card customers generated the highest revenue.
Bills & Entertainment were the top spending categories.
Businessmen and white-collar customers contributed maximum revenue.
Customers aged 30–50 years were the most active spenders.
High-income groups drove the largest share of revenue.
Texas, New York, and California ranked as the top states by credit card spending.

-> Tools & Technologies:-
Power BI Desktop → Data visualization & dashboards
Excel / CSV → Dataset (pre-processing)
SQL / DAX → Measures & calculations

-> Outcome:-
Built two interactive dashboards (Transaction Report & Customer Report).
Delivered insights into customer behavior, card usage trends, and revenue drivers.
Helped identify target segments for marketing and business strategy.
